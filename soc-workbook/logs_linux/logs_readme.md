# üßæ Practice: System Log Analysis (Linux)

## üéØ Objective
Explore and analyze system logs using `journalctl` in order to identify important events, warnings, and errors that affect the operating system's performance.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Commands used
```bash
journalctl -n 100 --no-pager
journalctl -p warning -n 50 --no-pager
journalctl -p err -n 50 --no-pager
journalctl -u NetworkManager -n 100 --no-pager
journalctl -p warning -n 50 --no-pager > evidencia_logs.txt
```

---

## üîç Practice description
During this practice, a detailed analysis of system logs was performed using the `journalctl` tool.  
Logs were filtered by type: **general**, **warning**, **error**, and **NetworkManager events** were also examined.  
The main goal was to understand how different system processes leave traces in log files and how that information can be interpreted for monitoring and troubleshooting.

## üñºÔ∏è Evidence

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ General logs
![General logs](./evidence/logs_general.png)  
Shows the latest events recorded by the system, including kernel processes, `systemd`, and other active services.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Warning logs
![Warning logs](./evidence/logs_warning.png)  
Displays warning messages generated by services like `wireplumber` and `gvfs-trash`, related to audio management and graphical file handling.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Error logs
![Error logs](./evidence/logs_err.png)  
Critical kernel errors are identified, generally associated with the virtualization environment and hardware load issues.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Network events
![Network events](./evidence/logs_NetworkManager.png)  
Shows the connection process managed by `NetworkManager`, including IP assignment and network interface activation.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Evidence file
![Evidence file](./evidence/logs_txt.png)  
Exported log file containing the most recent warning events for later analysis.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Conclusion
This practice helped me understand that logs are an essential source of information for system analysis and security.  
Each line in the logs tells part of the technical story of the operating system.  
Learning to read, filter, and classify these events is a key step in developing monitoring and incident-detection skills within a SOC environment.
